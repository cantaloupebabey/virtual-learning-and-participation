				 <h2>Mean posts per student: 5.5 posts<br>

					This first chart graphs time spent on the virtual platform to the number of posts; 
					it's a pretty strightforward chart. As the time spent online increases, 
					so does the number of posts. 
					Some students on the right side of the chart (and student #66 who was super active)
					are outliers, but the general trend shows that time and number of posts have a positive correlation. 
				</p>
				<br>

			 <canvas id="timeVGradechart" width="100%" height="50"></canvas>

				<br>
				<p>
					Chart 2 illustrates time spent online to the final grade of each student. 
					This time, we see a positive correlation, 
					as people who spent more time in the virtual classroom had higher final grades. 
					While there were people who didn't have to spent much time to earn a high grade, 
					there wasn't anyone who spent >128 minutes that failed the class.

			 	<br>
			 	<p>
					We know that time and number of posts are positively correlated, 
					but I still thought it was a good idea to do a number of posts to final grade chart.
					As we can see here, it's also positively correlated. The chart looks a little skewed 
					since student number 66 posted a lot but the grade value is limited. However, it's important
					to note that the biggest cluster around (5, 7) shows that many people who perhaps posted more
					moderately were also able to pass the class.

			<p>
				These final charts illustrate the relationship between number of reactions recieved to final grades 
				and number of posts to number of reactions recieved - measuring the correlation between peer reciprocation on grades 
				I hypothesized that grades are impacted by individual participation, but I would 
				like to accurately represent all the the data given. <br>
				Reactions recieved and grade have a positive correlation,
				but if you compare the number of posts v. final grade chart (chart 3), they look almost identical. 
				Additionally, the more posts posted by a student, the more reactions they will recieve.

   			<h1>Conclusion</h1>

   			<p class="lead">
				While the data shows that people with high participation always passed the class, 
				clusters in the graphs show that it does not necessarily mean that people with low participation always failed. 
				In fact, there were more than several people who failed the class that participated more than people who passed. 
				<br><br>
				While a pre-test in the original dataset would be necessary to make the most accurate predictions,
				my theory is that people who were mid-low effort but still passed the course would have gotten a high rating beforehand,
				while low effort-low grade subjects did not grow from their initially low-scoring state. 
				<br><br>
				So what does this mean for students learning online? It may not be necessary to overexert yourself over assignments
				or posting to the class stream super often (student #66, I'm looking at you), be aware of your abilities in current standing
				to determine how much you need to learn. Despite the data, it is still advisable to students to try their best during
				class time and on assignments :)
				<br><br>
				Something I would change about the procedure of this project is to use multiple linear regression or a function
				that would allow me to combine time online and number of posts variables - causation would be clearer.
